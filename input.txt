Constructing an unbreakable cipher is fairly easy. The technique has been known for a long time. Just take the data to be encrypted and a key which is equal to or larger than the size of the data. Use the bitwise XOR operation using both and we have an unbreakable cipher text. There are a lot of problem with using this technique though, the most important limitation being that the key needs to be at least equal to the size of the data. That means if we have 1 TB file to encrypt, we need a minimum 1 TB size key to encrypt it. Which is not really feasible. So we don't use it [1]
